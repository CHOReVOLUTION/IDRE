[CHOReVOLUTION IDRE](http://www.chorevolution.eu/) includes software tools for choreography modeling, synthesis, adaptation,
service bus, security, identity management and cloud (with monitoring and overall management at run-time).
The platform ensures the distributed coordination of services and things in a context characterized by dynamic changes. These include business goal changes, preferences and context-changes, as
services or partners may be substituted and network conditions may evolve.
Changes are dynamically handled by CHOReVOLUTION through the automatic generation of specific
artifacts, bringing:

**1. Coordination:** When service interactions need to be suitably coordinated in a fully distributed way in order to fulfill the specified choreography, coordination delegates are generated.

**2. Security:** When secure communication between services is required, CHOReVOLUTION generates security filters.

**3. Heterogeneity:** When middleware protocols vary among the stakeholders, CHOReVOLUTION generates binding components.

**4. Interoperability:** When heterogenous services with possibly mismatching interfaces need to communicate with each other, that is critical in IoT, the platform generates adapters
